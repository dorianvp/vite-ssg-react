# Vite React SSR

This repo served as a prototype for another project. It uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a server, [React](https://react.dev/) as the UI library and previously [Vike](https://vike.dev/) for a nice SSR/SSG abstraction.

I still have to extract components from this repo & integrate with a CMS or DB.
